## Scene 1 (Chaos 5)

```
Description:    Spy & investment (64 & 54)
Interpretation: She caught a kobold spy during her patrol
```

*(sound of snapping twigs)*

What, or who, ever stepped on that twig certainly was in a hurry. It certainly isn't an animal but what? A human? She follows the sound, carefully but swiftly she closes on it.

*(sound stops)*

She stops too and hides behind a tree. It took a second or two before she can hear it moving again. Not wanting to get too close to spook it again, she prepares an entangling arrow using some rope and an arrow.

She can barely hear its steps but it seems to be slowing down. She stealthily walks, weapon drawn and ready.

*(sounds of leaves rustling)*

A berry bush about 100ft is moving but she can't see what's causing it. She walks around and, at about 80ft or so from her, she spots it: a kobold.

Without a moment's hesitation, she fires. She aims for the creature's legs to disable and, hopefully, interrogate it.

```
Attack hits! (Attack 17 + 5 vs AC 12)
```

She finds her mark and before the creature realizes it, its legs are tied together. It falls down face-first into the bush. Not wanting more trouble, she dashes, grabs its snout up, and holds her dagger around its neck.

**"Shhh. Don't do anything stupid."**

The kobold moves its head up and down, careful not to move a neck muscle.

**"What are you doing here? What are you... things planning?"**

Her hate and contempt for the creature is palpable. The dagger pressed so hard, its starting to cut through its flesh. She releases the snout just enough to let it speak.

**"I was just... I was just hungry. No plan, just looking for food."**

The kobold is obviously afraid, which suprises her. That is something she hasn't seen or even imagined possible.

As much as she wanted to hate the thing, it does seem weird that it is alone. Based on her studies and experience, they prefer working in packs and they never come out this close to dawn.
