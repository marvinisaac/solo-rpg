## Chapter 01

```
Chaos:          5
Description:    Spy & investment (64 & 54)
Interpretation: Francine catches a kobold spy during her patrol
```
*(Somewhere in the forest)*

The sun is barely visible on the horizon, the air is cold, and the forest is calm. It's almost dawning and Francine has already started walking back to town when she suddenly hears the sound of snapping twigs. What, or who, ever stepped on those twigs seems to be in a hurry. It certainly isn't an animal but what? She follows the sound, carefully but swiftly she closes in on it.

The sound stops. She stops too and then hides behind a tree. It took a second or two before she can hear it moving again. Not wanting to get too close to it again, she prepares an entangling shot using some stone, rope, and an arrow.

She can barely hear its steps but it seems to be slowing down. She stealthily walks, weapon drawn and ready.

The sound of rustling leaves replaces the sound of twigs snapping. A berry bush about 100ft is moving but she can't see what's causing it. She walks around and, at about 50ft or so from her, she spots it: a kobold. Without a moment's hesitation, she fires. She aims for the creature's legs to disable and, hopefully, interrogate it.

```
Attack hits! (Attack 17 + 5 vs AC 12)
```

She finds her mark and before the creature realizes it, its legs are tied together. It falls down face-first into the bush. Not wanting more trouble, she dashes, takes out her dagger, grabs its berry-stained snout, holds it shut, pulls it up, and presses her weapon around its neck.

Francine

**"Shhh. Don't do anything stupid."**
</center>

The kobold moves its head up and down, careful not to move a neck muscle.

<center>
Francine

**"What are you doing here?"**
</center>

Her hate and contempt for the creature are palpable. The dagger is pressed so hard, it is starting to cut through its flesh. She releases the snout just enough to let it speak.

<center>
Kobold

**"I... I hungry. Just... just want food."**
</center>

The kobold is obviously afraid, which surprises her. That is something she hasn't seen or even imagined possible from these things.

As much as she wanted to kill the thing, it is weird that it seems to be alone. Based on her studies and experience, they prefer working in packs and they never come out this close to dawn.

Francine

**"Where are the others?"**
</center>

<center>
Kobold

**"Only me."**
</center>

```
Insight check fail (2 + 2 = 4 vs DC 9 = 8 + 1 [8 + 1d6])
Are there other kobolds around? Exceptional yes (Very likely, 12)
```

There were about half a dozen kobolds and another much taller figure watching the scene. She, despite the situation going against everything she knows, believes the creature. She can not bring herself to kill this helpless thing but she can't also let this go. She decides to take it back to town and let the others decide its fate.

She hits it with the butt of her dagger.

```
Attack with advantage hits! (Attack 16|19 + 5 vs AC 12)
Damage of 2 + 3
```

The dagger's butt squarely hits it at the top of its head, knocking it unconscious. She uses some more rope to tie its snout and hands. She also ties its feet and uses that to drag it on her way back.

*(Outside of town)*

As the sun comes up the horizon, the town's watchtower spots her. The guard, as soon as she enters earshot, shouts...

<center>
Watchtower guard

**"Nice catch there, Franz! Looks like our dinner will be kobold meat."**
</center>

<center>
Francine

**"Tom, just open the gate. If you cook this thing later, do NOT invite me."**
</center>

<center>
Tom

**"Their meat is tough but that is still meat."**
</center>

Tom and three more guards ready their crossbows as the town's gate is opened. Another has his sights on the kobold, just to be sure.

Swordstone is a small town, focused on producing its namesake: swords.

<center>
Captain

**"Who's your buddy there, Franz? Where did you catch that?"**
</center>

<center>
Francine

**"I found it nearby, foraging for berries. It was alone."**
</center>

<center>
Captain

**"Alone? Are you sure?"**
</center>

Just like her, the captain finds this very odd because they've never seen a kobold alone in the wild.

<center>
Francine

**"It is very unusual but there was nothing else around. I don't know what to do with it so, here."**
</center>

Eager to eat and get some sleep, she gives the rope to the captain.

```
Does the captain take care of it? Yes (50/50, 48)
```

<center>
Captain

**"Get some rest, I'm sending you back tonight. There might be some other stragglers like this."**
</center>

She was kind of expecting that since she's one of the best at tracking kobolds.

As she walks into town, away from the town's wooden palisade...

<center>
Tom

**"If you're not eating it, may I have your share later?"**
</center>

Without looking back, she gives him a thumbs up followed by a less friendly hand gesture.

<center>
Tom

**"Thank you!"**
</center>

She laughs and continues walking.
